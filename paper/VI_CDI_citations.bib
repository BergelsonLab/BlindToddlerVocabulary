This study investigated whether this maternal interactive style can have negative consequences on the psychological development of persons with acquired blindness, or whether it can be considered functional and appropriate to these individuals' needs during childhood. This aim was pursued by adopting attachment theory as a conceptual reference and administering the Adult Attachment Interview (AAI) to a sample of participants with early onset blindness. Results suggested that, as long as mothers are loving and are sensitive to their children's needs, their greater physical intervention and control of child exploration can play an important role in helping their severely sight-impaired children develop secure and well-balanced personalities.},

  abstract = {Objectives The primary objective of this study was to examine the quantity and quality of caregiver talk directed to children who are hard of hearing (CHH) as compared to children with normal hearing (CNH). For the CHH only, the study explored how caregiver input changed as a function of child age (18 months versus 3 years), which child and family factors contributed to variance in caregiver linguistic input at 18 months and 3 years, and how caregiver talk at 18 months related to child language outcomes at 3 years. Design Participants were 59 CNH and 156 children with bilateral, mild-to-severe hearing loss. When children were approximately 18-months and/or 3-years of age, caregivers and children participated in a 5-minute semi-structured, conversational interaction. Interactions were transcribed and coded for two features of caregiver input representing quantity (number of total utterances and number of total words) and four features representing quality (number of different words, mean length of utterance in morphemes, proportion of utterances that were high-level, and proportion of utterances that were directing). Additionally, at the 18-month visit, parents completed a standardized questionnaire regarding their child's communication development. At the 3-year visit, a clinician administered a standardized language measure. Results At the 18-month visit, the CHH were exposed to a greater proportion of directing utterances than the CNH. At the 3-year visit, there were significant differences between the CNH and CHH for number of total words and all four of the quality variables, with the CHH being exposed to fewer words and lower quality input. Caregivers generally provided higher quality input to CHH at the 3-year visit, as compared to the 18-month visit. At the 18-month visit, quantity variables, but not quality variables, were related to several child and family factors. At the 3-year visit, the variable most strongly related to caregiver input was child language. Longitudinal analyses indicated that quality, but not quantity, of caregiver linguistic input at 18 months was related to child language abilities at 3 years, with directing utterances accounting for significant unique variance in child language outcomes. Conclusions Although caregivers of CHH increased their use of quality features of linguistic input over time, the differences as compared to CNH suggest that some caregivers may need additional support to provide their children with optimal language learning environments. This is particularly important given the relationships that were identified between quality features of caregivers' linguistic input and children's language abilities. Family supports should include a focus on developing a style that is conversational-eliciting as opposed to directive.},

With audio-and video-recorded longitudinal data from six children (with varying degrees of vision) aged 0; 9\textendash 3; 4, we show that there ARE basic differences in early language, which appear to reflect differences in cognitive development. We focus here on early lexical acquisition and on verbal role-play, demonstrating how previous analyses have failed to observe aspects of the blind child's language system because language was considered out of the context of use. While a comparison of early vocabularies does suggest surface similarities, we found that when sighted peers are actively forming hypotheses about word meanings, totally blind children are acquiring largely unanalysed `labels'. They are slow to extend words and rarely overextended any. Similarly, although verbal role-play appears early, attempts to incorporate this kind of language into conversations with others reveal clear problems with reversibility \textendash{} specifically, the ability to understand the role of shifting perspectives in determining word meaning. Examination of language in context suggests that blind children have difficulties in just those areas of language acquisition where visual information can provide input about the world and be a stimulus for forming hypotheses about pertinent aspects of the linguistic system.},

We show that variation cannot be uniquely attributed to either of these, but find evidence that experiential input may influence some areas while linguistic input more strongly affects others. Moreover, there is a complex interaction between these. We also find independent adaptive strategies by the children, pointing to a plasticity in the acquisition process itself.},

Of primary concern was how they coordinated their attention to people and objects. Observations were coded using a state-based scheme that included a state of coordinated joint engagement as well as states of person engagement, object engagement, onlooking, and passive joint engagement. All developmental trends observed were similar regardless of partner: person engagement declined with age, while coordinated joint engagement increased. Passive joint engagement, object engagement, and onlooking did not change with age. However, the absolute amount of some engagement states was affected by partner: both passive and coordinated joint engagement were much more likely when infants played with mothers. We conclude that mothers may indeed support or "scaffold" their infants' early attempts to embed objects in social interaction, but that as attentional capabilities develop even quite unskilled peers may be appropriate partners for the exercise of these capacities.},

One possibility is that infants tend to link a label with whichever object they are focused on when they hear the label. If so, infants would make a mapping error when an adult labels a different object than the one occupying their focus. Alternatively, infants may be able to use a speaker's nonverbal cues (e.g., line of regard) to interpret the reference of novel labels. This ability would allow infants to avoid errors when adult labels conflict with infants' focus. 64 16\textendash 19-month-olds were taught new labels for novel toys in 2 situations. In follow-in labeling, the experimenter looked at and labeled a toy at which infants were already looking. In discrepant labeling, the experimenter looked at and labeled a different toy than the one occupying infants' focus. Infants' responses to subsequent comprehension questions revealed that they (a) successfully learned the labels introduced during follow-in labeling, and (b) displayed no tendency to make mapping errors after discrepant labeling. Thus infants of only 16 to 19 months understand that a speaker's nonverbal cues are relevant to the reference of object labels; they already can contribute to the social coordination involved in achieving joint reference.},

The first challenge is answered by the available evidence: Infants indeed capitalize on social understanding to interpret new words.

We replicate previous studies with small samples showing extensive variation in use of common nouns between age o;8 and 1;4 (i.e. `referential style'), and in the proportion of vocabulary made up of closed-class words between 1;4 and 2;6 (i.e. `analytic' vs. `holistic' style). However, both style dimensions are confounded with developmental changes in the composition of the lexicon, including three `waves' of reorganization: (1) an initial increase in percentage of common nouns from 0 to 100 words, followed by a proportional decrease; (2) a slow linear increase in verbs and other predicates, with the greatest gains taking place between 100 and 400 words; (3) no proportional development at all in the use of closed-class vocabulary between 0 and 400 words, followed by a sharp increase from 400 to 680 words. When developmental changes in noun use are controlled, referential-style measures do not show the association with developmental precocity reported in previous studies, although these scores are related to maternal education. By contrast, when developmental changes in grammatical function word use are controlled, high closed-class scores are associated with a slower rate of development. We suggest that younger children may have less perceptual acuity and/or shorter memory spans than older children with the same vocabulary size. As a result, the younger children may ignore unstressed function words until a later point in development while the older children tend to reproduce perceptual details that they do not yet understand. Longitudinal data show that early use of function words (under 400 words) is not related to grammatical levels after the 4OO-word point, confirming our `stylistic' interpretation of early closed-class usage. We close with recommendations for the unconfounding of stylistic and developmental variance in research on individual differences in language development, and provide look-up tables that will permit other investigators to pull these aspects apart.},

However, is their early lexicon structured and acquired like older learners? We test 6-mo-olds for a hallmark of the mature lexicon: cross-word relations. We also examine whether properties of the home environment that have been linked with lexical knowledge in older children are detectable in the initial stage of comprehension. We use a new dataset, which includes in-lab comprehension and home measures from the same infants. We find evidence for cross-word structure: On seeing two images of common nouns, infants looked significantly more at named target images when the competitor images were semantically unrelated (e.g., milk and foot) than when they were related (e.g., milk and juice), just as older learners do. We further find initial evidence for home-lab links: common noun ``copresence'' (i.e., whether words' referents were present and attended to in home recordings) correlated with in-lab comprehension. These findings suggest that, even in neophyte word learners, cross-word relations are formed early and the home learning environment measurably helps shape the lexicon from the outset.},

  abstract = {Infants' understanding of a pointing gesture represents a major milestone in their communicative development. The current consensus is that infants are not capable of following a pointing gesture until 9-12 months of age. In this article, we present evidence from 4- and 6-month-old infants challenging this conclusion. Infants were tested with a spatial cueing paradigm in Experiment 1 (500-ms stimulus-target onset asynchrony [SOA]) and Experiment 2 (100-ms SOA). The results revealed that the younger infants shifted their attention in the cued direction when presented with a pointing gesture and with a foil (i.e., same size and shape as pointing gesture) at both SOAs. Older infants shifted their attention only in response to the pointing gesture at 100-ms SOA. Experiment 3 tested infants' preferences for the social stimulus (i.e., pointing gesture) relative to the foil and a non-social stimulus (i.e., an arrow). The results revealed that infants are biased to selectively attend to the pointing gesture. Taken together, these results suggest that 4- and 6-month-old infants are capable of preferentially selecting and following a pointing gesture. It is theorized that this early capacity assists infants in their developing understanding of triadic forms of communication.},

The early vocabulary of the blind children paralleled that of the sighted children in the age and speed of acquisition, and in the underlying characteristics of what the children chose to label. These reflect a sensorimotor organization in which self-action and perceptual change are the salient variables. The early words of the blind children differed from those of sighted children in the percentage of words in each of Nelson's grammatical categories. This suggests differences in how the children use language. These differences are discussed as a function of the children's lack of vision and their particular language learning context.},

Ecological self-knowledge, which is necessary for joint attention, is impaired in blind infants and is evidenced by their reaching for objects on external cues, which also marks the beginning of their Stage 4 understanding of space and object. Entry into Stage 4 should occur before joint attention emerges in these infants. In a case study of two totally blind infants, the development of joint attention was longitudinally examined during Stage 4 in monthly sessions involving interactions with objects and familiar adults. The interactions were scored for behavior preliminary to joint attention, behavior liberally construed as joint attention, and behavior conservatively construed as joint attention. Behavior preliminary to joint attention occurred throughout Stage 4: behavior suggestive of joint attention by both liberal and conservative standards emerged initially in Stage 4 and became prevalent by mid to late Stage 4. The findings are discussed in terms of how they inform our thinking about the development of joint attention with respect to the importance of vision, cognition, social context, language, and early self-knowledge.}

Subjects were speakers of British English selected from a wide age range, so that differences in the responses across age groups could be compared. Within the subset of early acquired noun/verb homonyms, the verb forms were rated as later acquired than the nouns, and the verb homonyms of high-image ability nouns were rated as significantly less imageable than their noun counterparts. A small number of words received significantly earlier or later age of acquisition ratings when the 20\textendash 40 years and 50\textendash 80 years age groups were compared. These tend to comprise words that have come to be used more frequently in recent years (either through technological advances or social change), or those that have fallen out of common usage. Regression analyses showed that although word length, familiarity, and concreteness make independent contributions to the age of acquisition measure, frequency and imageability are the most important predictors of rated age of acquisition.},

This behavioral advantage, known as the concreteness effect, is often considered as evidence for embodied semantics, which emphasizes the role of sensorimotor experience in the comprehension of word meaning. In this view, online sensorimotor simulations triggered by concrete words, but not by abstract words, facilitate access to word meaning and speed up word identification. To test whether perceptual simulation is the driving force underlying the concreteness effect, we compared data from early-blind and sighted individuals performing an auditory lexical-decision task. Subjects were presented with property words referring to abstract (e.g., ``logic''), concrete multimodal (e.g., ``spherical''), and concrete unimodal visual concepts (e.g., ``blue''). According to the embodied account, the processing advantage for concrete unimodal visual words should disappear in the early blind because they cannot rely on visual experience and simulation during semantics processing (i.e., purely visual words should be abstract for early-blind people). On the contrary, we found that both sighted and blind individuals are faster when processing multimodal and unimodal visual words compared with abstract words. This result suggests that the concreteness effect does not depend on perceptual simulations but might be driven by modality-independent properties of word meaning.

A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted of population-based datasets relevant to global VI and blindness from 1980. Hierarchical models were fitted to estimate- by age, country, and year- the 2020 prevalence of (1) mild VI (presenting visual acuity worse than 6/12 to 6/18 inclusive), moderate to severe VI (MSVI; presenting visual acuity worse than 6/18 to 3/60 inclusive), and blindness (presenting visual acuity worse than 3/60); and (2) functional presbyopia (defined as presenting near vision worse than N6 or N8 at 40cm where best-corrected distance visual acuity was better than 6/12). Ninety-five percent uncertainty intervals (UI) were calculated.    Globally, among 7.79 billion people living in 2020, an estimated 49.1 million (95\% UI: 39.0-61.3 million; 54\% female) were blind (0.62\%; 95\% UI:0.49\%-0.78\%), 221.4 million (95\% UI: 197.7-247.0 million) people (2.81\%; 95\% UI:2.51\%-3.13\%; 55\% female) had moderate VI, 33.6 million (95\% UI: 29.7-38.0 million) people (0.43\%; 95\% UI:0.38\%-0.48\%; 57\% female) had severe VI. The estimated number of blind persons increased (by 42.8\%) from 34.4 million in 1990 to 49.1 million in 2020 yet global all-age age-standardised prevalence of blindness decreased between 1990 (0.85\%; 95\% UI:0.68\%-1.1\%) and 2019 (0.60\%; 95\% UI:0.48\%-0.75\%). Greatest reductions were observed in South Asia (-49\%) and North Africa and Middle East (-43\%) with the smallest changes in high income regions.    There is an ongoing reduction in the age-standardised prevalence of blindness and VI, yet the growth and ageing of the world's population is causing a substantial increase in number of people affected. Notable inter-regional and gender inequalities exist which highlight the need to scale up vision impairment alleviation efforts at all levels.  This is a 2020 ARVO Annual Meeting abstract.},

The age of pointing onset was established to within 2 weeks. Babies were also tested at monthly intervals on a number of tasks designed to study the relation between language acquisition, fine motor skills, handedness and detour problem solving. Acquisition of fine motor control in the pincer grip precedes pointing. Girls pointed slightly before boys and age of pointing onset (ca ll.3 months) predicts both the number of gestures produced and the number of sounds comprehended at 14.4 months. Unimanual right-handed problem solving sequences predict MacArthur gestures. Both the relative balance of fine motor activity between the hands, and collaborative bimanual activity with right-hand dominance, predict speech comprehension and speech production at 14.4 months. Detour problem solving does not predict any of the language skills measured by the MacArthur test. These results suggest that onset of pointing may be linked both to gesture and to speech through developmental changes in cerebral dominance. It is possible that there are sex differences in this process.}

Studying knowledge of the perceptually inaccessible sensory domain for these populations offers a lens into how humans learn about that which they cannot perceive. We first review the linguistic strategies within language that communicate sensory information. Highlighting the power of language to shape knowledge, we next review the detailed knowledge of sensory information by individuals with congenital sensory impairments, limitations therein, and neural representations of imperceptible phenomena. We suggest that the acquisition of sensory knowledge is supported by language, experience with multiple perceptual domains, and cognitive and social abilities which mature over the first years of life, both in individuals with and without sensory impairment. We conclude by proposing a developmental trajectory for acquiring sensory knowledge in the absence of sensory perception.},

  abstract = {At around 1 year of age, human infants display a number of new behaviors that seem to indicate a newly emerging understanding of other persons as intentional beings whose attention to outside objects may be shared, followed into, and directed in various ways. These behaviors have mostly been studied separately. In the current study, we investigated the most important of these behaviors together as they emerged in a single group of 24 infants between 9 and 15 months of age. At each of seven monthly visits, we measured joint attentional engagement, gaze and point following, imitation of two different kinds of actions on objects, imperative and declarative gestures, and comprehension and production of language. We also measured several nonsocial-cognitive skills as a point of comparison. We report two studies. The focus of the first study was the initial emergence of infants' social-cognitive skills and how these skills are related to one another developmentally. We found a reliable pattern of emergence: Infants progressed from sharing to following to directing others' attention and behavior. The nonsocial skills did not emerge predictably in this developmental sequence. Furthermore, correlational analyses showed that the ages of emergence of all pairs of the social-cognitive skills or their components were interrelated. The focus of the second study was the social interaction of infants and their mothers, especially with regard to their skills of joint attentional engagement (including mothers' use of language to follow into or direct infants' attention) and how these skills related to infants' early communicative competence. Our measures of communicative competence included not only language production, as in previous studies, but also language comprehension and gesture production. It was found that two measures-the amount of time infants spent in joint engagement with their mothers and the degree to which mothers used language that followed into their infant's focus of attention-predicted infants' earliest skills of gestural and linguistic communication. Results of the two studies are discussed in terms of their implications for theories of social-cognitive development, for theories of language development, and for theories of the process by means of which human children become fully participating members of the cultural activities and processes into which they are born.},

  abstract = {Children vary greatly in the number of words they know when they enter school, a major factor influencing subsequent school and workplace success. This variability is partially explained by the differential quantity of parental speech to preschoolers. However, the contexts in which young learners hear new words are also likely to vary in referential transparency; that is, in how clearly word meaning can be inferred from the immediate extralinguistic context, an aspect of input quality. To examine this aspect, we asked 218 adult participants to guess 50 parents' words from (muted) videos of their interactions with their 14- to 18-mo-old children. We found systematic differences in how easily individual parents' words could be identified purely from this socio-visual context. Differences in this kind of input quality correlated with the size of the children's vocabulary 3 y later, even after controlling for differences in input quantity. Although input quantity differed as a function of socioeconomic status, input quality (as here measured) did not, suggesting that the quality of nonverbal cues to word meaning that parents offer to their children is an individual matter, widely distributed across the population of parents.},

The current work focuses on the effect of children's hearing loss on parent\textendash child interactions when parents and their toddlers jointly played with a set of toy objects. We compared the linguistic input received by toddlers with hearing loss (HL) and their chronological age-matched (CA) and hearing age-matched (HA) normal-hearing peers. Moreover, we used head-mounted eye trackers to examine how different parental linguistic input affected children's visual attention on objects when parents either led or followed children's attention during joint object play. Overall, parents of children with HL provided comparable amount of linguistic input as parents of the two normal-hearing groups. However, the types of linguistic input produced by parents of children with HL were similar to the CA group in some ways and similar to the HA group in other ways. Interestingly, the effects of different types of linguistic input on extending the attention of children with HL qualitatively resembled the patterns seen in the CA group, even though the effects were less pronounced in the HL group. We discuss the implications of these results for our understanding of the reciprocal, dynamic, and multi-factored nature of parent\textendash child interactions.},

The role of several moderators was examined: pointing modality, pointing motive, age at which the pointing was measured, the assessment method of the pointing gesture and language development, the modality of language, SES, and country. The results showed both a concurrent (r=.52) and a longitudinal (r=.35) relation between pointing and language development. The relation between pointing and language development became stronger with age, and was found for pointing with a declarative and general motive, but not for pointing with an imperative motive. It is concluded that the pointing gesture is a key joint-attention behavior involved in the acquisition of language.},

Acquiring the sound system requires the infant to learn about sounds and their distributions, sound combinations, and prosodic information, such as syllables, rhythm, and stress. These aspects of the phonological system are being learned simultaneously as the infant experiences the language around him or her. What binds all of the phonological units is the context in which they occur, namely, words. In this review, we explore the development of phonetics and phonology by showcasing the interactive nature of the developing lexicon and sound system with a focus on perception. We first review seminal research in the foundations of phonological development. We then discuss early word recognition and learning followed by a discussion of phonological and lexical representations. We conclude by discussing the interactive nature of lexical and phonological representations and highlight some further directions for exploring the developing sound system.

Participants showed evidence of vocabulary understanding across all PPVT-III content categories with no strong evidence of disproportionate numbers of errors in any specific content area despite below-average mean standard scores. However, whereas mean standard scores were below the test mean established for hearing children when based on CA, they were within the average range for hearing children when calculated based on HA. Thus, children's vocabulary knowledge was commensurate with years of cochlear implant experience, providing support for the role of spoken language experience in vocabulary acquisition.},

The two instruments, one designed for 8-16-month-old infants, the other for 16-30-month-old toddlers, are both reliable and valid, confirming the value of parent reports that are based on contemporary behavior and a recognition format. Growth trends are described for children scoring at the 10th-, 25th-, 50th-, 75th-, and 90th-percentile levels on receptive and expressive vocabulary, actions and gestures, and a number of aspects of morphology and syntax. Extensive variability exists in the rate of lexical, gestural, and grammatical development. The wide variability across children in the time of onset and course of acquisition of these skills challenges the meaningfulness of the concept of the modal child. At the same time, moderate to high intercorrelations are found among the different skills both concurrently and predictively (across a 6-month period). Sex differences consistently favor females; however, these are very small, typically accounting for 1\%-2\% of the variance. The effects of SES and birth order are even smaller within this age range. The inventories offer objective criteria for defining typicality and exceptionality, and their cost effectiveness facilitates the aggregation of large data sets needed to address many issues of contemporary theoretical interest. The present data also offer unusually detailed information on the course of development of individual lexical, gestural, and grammatical items and features. Adaptations of the CDIs to other languages have opened new possibilities for cross-linguistic explorations of sequence, rate, and variability of communicative development.},

  abstract = {Background Optic nerve hypoplasia (ONH) has developed into a leading cause of congenital blindness. The frequently associated features of hypopituitarism and absent septum pellucidum were felt to have embryonic linkage as ``septo-optic dysplasia'' or ``de Morsier's syndrome.'' More recent studies have suggested these associations are independent of one another. This review provides an assessment of the historical and recent evidence linking neuroradiologic, endocrinologic and developmental morbidity in patients with ONH. The prenatal risk factors, heritability, and genetic mutations associated with ONH are described. Results Recognition of the critical association of ONH with hypopituitarism should be attributed to William Hoyt, not Georges de Morsier. De Morsier never described a case of ONH or recognized its association with hypopituitarism or missing septum pellucidum. Hypopituitarism is caused by hypothalamic dysfunction. This, and other more recently identified associations with ONH, such as developmental delay and autism, are independent of septum pellucidum development. Other common neuroradiographic associations such as corpus callosum hypoplasia, gyrus dysplasia, and cortical heterotopia may have prognostic significance. The predominant prenatal risk factors for ONH are primiparity and young maternal age. Presumed risk factors such as prenatal exposure to drugs and alcohol are not supported by scrutiny of the literature. Heritability and identified gene mutations in cases of ONH are rare. Conclusion Children with ONH require monitoring for many systemic, developmental, and even life-threatening problems independent of the severity of ONH and presence of brain malformations including abnormalities of the septum pellucidum. ``Septo-optic dysplasia'' and ``de Morsier's syndrome'' are historically inaccurate and clinically misleading terms.},

  abstract = {The study investigated pointing at memorized targets in reachable space in congenitally blind (CB) and blindfolded sighted (BS) children (6, 8, 10 and 12~years; ten children in each group). The target locations were presented on a sagittal plane by passive positioning of the left index finger. A go signal for matching the target location with the right index finger was provided 0 or 4~s after demonstration. An age effect was found only for absolute distance errors and the surface area of pointing was smaller for the CB children. Results indicate that early visual experience and age are not predictive factors for pointing in children. The delay was an important factor at all ages and for both groups, indicating distinct spatial representations such as egocentric and allocentric frames of reference, for immediate and delayed pointing, respectively. Therefore, the CB like the BS children are able to use both ego- and allocentric frames of reference.},

  abstract = {This paper describes and discusses issues pertaining to investigating meaning construal in the language of the blind. It introduces key problems in this largely unexplored area and proposes possible avenues of research by outlining four studies conducted over a period of eight years. The central arguments are built around the fundamental cognitive linguistic premise that language is an experiential phenomenon intimately related to general cognitive processes. The author focuses on the role of salience (or attention) and demonstrates how it is coded in the language of the blind. The main part of the paper starts with the outline of two exploratory studies the aim of which was to identify possible differences in salience and situatedness. The author discusses the contribution of the two studies and proceeds by describing a more focused study whose hypotheses were motivated by some of the questions raised in the previous two studies. The primary research question was related to the idea of the primacy of space in the blinds' mental imagery and meaning construal. Finally, the author proposes a model integrating key language internal and language external factors affecting the process of meaning construal in this extraordinary population, and finishes by describing the fourth study whose primary aim was to double\textendash{} test the research instrument used to investigate spatial (topological) elements in the language of the blind.},

We tested the effectiveness of automated early language environment estimates for children 2 to 36 months old to predict cognitive and language skills 10 years later and examined effects for specific developmental age periods.Daylong audio recordings for 146 infants and toddlers were completed monthly for 6 months, and the total number of daily adult words and adult-child conversational turnswere automatically estimated with Language Environment Analysis software. Follow-up evaluations at 9 to 14 years of age included language and cognitive testing. Language exposure for 3 age groups was assessed: 2 to 17 months, 18 to 24 months, and {$\geq$}25 months. Pearson correlations and multiple linear regression analyses were conducted.Conversational turn counts at 18 to 24 months of age accounted for 14\% to 27\% of the variance in IQ, verbal comprehension, and receptive and/or expressive vocabulary scores 10 years later after controlling for SES. Adult word counts between 18 and 24 months were correlated with language outcomes but were considerably weakened after controlling for SES.These data support the hypothesis that early talk and interaction, particularly during the relatively narrow developmental window of 18 to 24 months of age, can be used to predict school-age language and cognitive outcomes. With these findings, we underscore the need for effective early intervention programs that support parents in creating an optimal early language learning environment in the home.},

Of particular interest is how this relation is affected by learning in various contextual conditions. Infants (16\textendash 20 months; n=48) were presented with eight novel noun categories in one of three contextual conditions (same context, varied context, or a combination of same and varied contexts), and tested for their generalization ability in a new context. Context was defined as the colored and patterned fabric upon which the object was presented. Results suggest that visual attention during learning is associated with category generalization ability in a new context only for infants whose learning took place in a combination of same and varied background contexts. The results are discussed in terms of the mechanisms by which context affects generalization.},

A chronological record of nouns and other word classes was coded from the diary records.Thirteen children evidenced a prolonged period of up to three months during which rate of acquisition markedly increased.

These results suggest that the terms `vocabulary spurt' and `naming explosion' best describe children who focus their early linguistic efforts on a single strategy: learning names for things. Other children may attempt to encode a broad range of experience with a more varied lexicon, a strategy that results in more gradual lexical growth.},

  abstract = {Background Parent-child interaction is essential to promote adaptive emotional, cognitive, and social development. The majority of previous research on parent-child interaction is largely dependent on face-to-face exchanges that require the interactive partners to visually recognize reciprocal communicative bids. Therefore, previous findings in the field can only partially apply to the early interactive patterns occurring between visually impaired infants and their parents. The present study was aimed to systematically review the available evidence on parent-child interaction in the context of developmental visual impairment. Methods Fourteen papers were finally selected after literature search on PubMed and Scopus. Data synthesis was focused on three core topics: visually impaired children's contribution to the interaction, parental caregiving behaviors with visually impaired children, and the association between parents' behaviors and the developmental outcomes of children with visual impairment. Results Visually impaired children may exhibit reduced reactivity to maternal stimuli and less-than-optimal levels of interactive initiations in social exchanges. Parents of children with visual impairment may use more descriptive communicative acts and greater directiveness compared to mothers of sighted counterparts. Specific caregiving behaviors (e.g., responsiveness and goal setting) of parents of children with visual impairment may significantly support language and socio-emotional development as well as sensorimotor integration. Discussion Children with visual impairment may be less responsive and they may produce less clear communicative bids while interacting with their parents. Their parents may face specific challenges while engaging with them and they may become increasingly directive and intrusive. Nonetheless, even in the presence of visual impairment, the quality of parental caregiving behaviors appears to play a potential preventive role in the face of children's socio-emotional and cognitive outcomes. These results suggest that early interventions focused on parent-child interactions are especially needed in this population.},

Behavioral studies suggest that a language-specific weighting of these cues develops during the first year of life; recent work on German revealed that eight-month-olds, unlike six-month-olds, are capable of perceiving a prosodic boundary on the basis of pitch change and final lengthening only. The present study uses Event-Related Potentials (ERPs) to investigate the neuro-cognitive development of prosodic cue perception in German-learning infants. In adults? ERPs, prosodic boundary perception is clearly reflected by the so-called Closure Positive Shift (CPS). To date, there is mixed evidence on whether an infant CPS exists that signals early prosodic cue perception, or whether the CPS emerges only later?the latter implying that infantile brain responses to prosodic boundaries reflect acoustic, low-level pause detection.We presented six- and eight-month-olds with stimuli containing either no boundary cues, only a pitch cue, or a combination of both pitch change and final lengthening. For both age groups, responses to the former two conditions did not differ, while brain responses to prosodic boundaries cued by pitch change and final lengthening showed a positivity that we interpret as a CPS-like infant ERP component. This hints at an early sensitivity to prosodic boundaries that cannot exclusively be based on pause detection. Instead, infants? brain responses indicate an early ability to exploit subtle, relational prosodic cues in speech perception?presumably even earlier than could be concluded from previous behavioral results.},

In this study vocabulary growth rates are characterized for each of 22 children by using data obtained at several time points from 14 to 26 mo. A substantial relation between individual differences in vocabulary acquisition and variations in the amount that particular mothers speak to their children was found. It is argued that the relation between amount of parent speech and vocabulary growth reflects parent effects on the child, rather than child-ability effects on the parent or hereditary factors. It was also found that gender is an important factor in rate of vocabulary growth. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

However, for syntax, earlier child speech does not significantly predict later caregiver speech, suggesting a causal flow from caregiver to child. Finally, demographic factors, notably SES, are related to language growth, and are, at least partially, mediated by differences in caregiver speech, showing the pervasive influence of caregiver speech on language growth.},

Accuracy was greater for immediate than delayed pointing and there was an effect of delay for the orientation of the main axis of the pointing distribution in both groups, indicating distinct spatial representations with development such as ego- and allocentric frames of reference, respectively. The pointing responses of the blind covered less surface area indicating better overall accuracy as compared to the sighted blindfolded. The hands differed for four of the six precision and accuracy parameters. The right hand performed better and seemed relatively contextually oriented, whereas the responses of the left hand were closer to the body and egocentrically oriented. The elongation of the scatter of the pointing responses was greater for the boys and more allocentrically oriented, indicating gender differences in spatial representation. The study provides a first evidence of ego- and allocentric spatial frames of reference in congenitally blind children and an ability to point at targets with the left and right hands in the total absence of vision.},

The purpose of this study was to explore gesture use in congenitally blind individuals who have never seen gesture and have no experience with its communicative function. Four children blind from birth were tested in 3 discourse situations (narrative, reasoning, and spatial directions) and compared with groups of sighted and blindfolded sighted children. Blind children produced gestures, although not in all of the contexts in which sighted children gestured, and the gestures they produced resembled those of sighted children in both form and content. Results suggest that gesture may serve a function for the speaker that is independent of its impact on the listener. When people talk, they gesture. With movements of their hands, speakers indicate size, shape, direction, and distance, lend emphasis to particular words, and highlight essential phrases. Gestures have been observed in children before they can talk (e.g., Acredolo \& Goodwyn, 1988; Bates, 1976) and in speakers from a variety of cultural and linguistic backgrounds (see Feyereisen \& de Lannoy, 1991 ). Because gesture is less codified than speech and has the potential to convey information imagistically (McNeill, 1992), meanings not easily encoded into speech can be conveyed in the accompanying gestural stream. As a result, gesture can convey information that is not explicitly encoded in speech, thus providing a unique window into the mind of},

The authors examined gesture development in 5 congenitally blind and 5 sighted toddlers videotaped longitudinally between the ages of 14 and 28 months in their homes while engaging in free play with a parent or experimenter. All of the blind children were found to produce at least some gestures during the one-word stage of language development. However, gesture production was relatively low among the blind children relative to their sighted peers. Moreover, although blind and sighted children produced the same overall set of gesture types, the distribution of gesture types across categories differed. In addition, blind children used gestures primarily to communicate about objects that were nearby, while sighted children used them for nearby as well as distally located objects. These findings suggest that gesture may play different roles in the language-learning process for sighted and blind children. Nevertheless, it is clear that gesture is a robust phenomenon of early communicative development, emerging even in the absence of experience with a visual model.

In this study, we ask whether infants' ability to track transitional probabilities between syllables in an artificial language can scale up to the challenge of natural language. We do so by testing both 5.5- and 8-month-olds' ability to segment an artificial language containing four words of uniform length (all CVCV) or four words of varying length (two CVCV, two CVCVCV). The transitional probability cues to word boundaries were held equal across the two languages. Both age groups segmented the language containing words of uniform length, demonstrating that even 5.5-month-olds are extremely sensitive to the conditional probabilities in their environment. However, neither age group succeeded in segmenting the language containing words of varying length, despite the fact that the transitional probability cues defining word boundaries were equally strong in the two languages. We conclude that infants' statistical learning abilities may not be as robust as earlier studies have suggested.},

Results       The CI group had a larger expressive vocabulary size than the receptive vocabulary          size\textendash matched NH group.

The CI group had a larger proportion of predicate words than the NH group, but no          difference was found in closed-class words in expressive vocabulary.

The infants demonstrated an ability to detect strong/weak target words in sentential contexts. Moreover, the findings indicated that the infants were responding to the whole words and not to just their strong syllables. In Part II, a parallel series of studies was conducted examining 7.5 month olds' abilities to segment words with weak/strong stress patterns. In contrast with the results for strong/weak words, 7.5 month olds appeared to missegment weak/strong words. They demonstrated a tendency to treat strong syllables as markers of word onsets. In addition, when weak/strong words co-occurred with a particular following weak syllable (e.g., ``guitar is''), 7.5 month olds appeared to misperceive these as strong/weak words (e.g., ``taris''). The studies in Part III examined the abilities of 10.5 month olds to segment weak/strong words from fluent speech. These older infants were able to segment weak/strong words correctly from the various contexts in which they appeared. Overall, the findings suggest that English learners may rely heavily on stress cues when they begin to segment words from fluent speech. However, within a few months time, infants learn to integrate multiple sources of information about the likely boundaries of words in fluent speech.},

With a vast number of cases now being reported, the rarity of ONH is obviously now refuted. The major aspects of ophthalmic evaluation of an infant with possible ONH are visual assessment, fundus examination, and visual electrophysiology. Characteristically, the disc is small, there is a peripapillary double-ring sign, vascular tortuosity, and thinning of the nerve fiber layer. A patient with ONH should be assessed for presence of neurologic, radiologic, and endocrine associations. There may be maternal associations like premature births, fetal alcohol syndrome, maternal diabetes. Systemic associations in the child include endocrine abnormalities, developmental delay, cerebral palsy, and seizures. Besides the hypoplastic optic nerve and chiasm, neuroimaging shows abnormalities in ventricles or white- or gray-matter development, septo-optic dysplasia, hydrocephalus, and corpus callosum abnormalities. There is a greater incidence of clinical neurologic abnormalities in patients with bilateral ONH (65\%) than patients with unilateral ONH. We present a review on the available literature on the same to urge caution in our clinical practice when dealing with patients with ONH. Fundus photography, ocular coherence tomography, visual field testing, color vision evaluation, neuroimaging, endocrinology consultation with or without genetic testing are helpful in the diagnosis and management of ONH.

Many previous studies document a decline in nonnative phonetic perception between 6 and 12 months of age.

We hypothesized that language experience in the first year facilitates native-language phonetic performance between 6 and 12 months of age. We tested 6\textendash 8- and 10\textendash 12-month-old infants in the United States and Japan to examine native and nonnative patterns of developmental change using the American English /r-l/ contrast. The goals of the experiment were to: (a) determine whether facilitation characterizes native-language phonetic change between 6 and 12 months of age, (b) examine the decline previously observed for nonnative contrasts and (c) test directional asymmetries for consonants. The results show a significant increase in performance for the native-language contrast in the first year, a decline in nonnative perception over the same time period, and indicate directional asymmetries that are constant across age and culture. We argue that neural commitment to native-language phonetic properties explains the pattern of developmental change in the first year.},

We accept as self-evident that any explanation of this learning must take nonlinguistic experience as relevant: When children hear words spoken by adults, they also observe objects, scenes, and events. Yet the issues here are quite perplexing because, at least to first inspection, heard words seem to map only very inexactly onto the child's observations of objects, scenes, and events.  In light of such difficulties, we tried to get some insight into how the child constructs the right mappings between words and the world by examining a situation in which the opportunities to observe the world are diminished: the case of langauge learning by congenitally blind children.  There is an evidently unshakable tradition which asserts that the blind must in principle be defective in their learning\textemdash of language, of space, and more.  We shall document that these a priori opinions cannot survive confrontation with the reality of language learning in congenitally blind children. Blind learners not only learn the forms of language but their meanings as well; their speech cannot be characterized as replete with "verbalisms" (the clinical term for blind learners' putative use of certain words as "sound without meaning").

By 12.5 mo, most Ss pointed, usually vocalizing or looking at their partner while pointing. The communicative function of the gesture was further established by the partner's response of verbal acknowledgment and looking at the object. The ability to follow another's points seemed to be acquired before Ss began to point but improved with their own use of the gesture. Reaching partook of the behaviors associated with pointing but developed earlier and decreased as pointing increased. Data show that at an early age Ss exhibit an elementary form of the ability to take the visual perspective of others. (12 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = {Infants' pointing gestures are clear and salient markers of their interest. As a result, they afford infants with a targeted and precise way of eliciting information from others. The current study investigated whether, similar to older children's question asking, infants' pointing gestures are produced to obtain information. Specifically, in a single experimental study, we examined whether 18-month-olds (N\,=\,36) point to request specific types of information and how this translates into learning across domains. We elicited pointing from infants in a context that would naturally lend itself to information seeking (i.e., out-of-reach novel objects). In response to infants' points, an experimenter provided a label, a function, or no information for each pointed-to object. We assessed infants' persistence after receiving different types of information and their subsequent ability to form label-object or function-object associations. When infants pointed and received no information or functions, they persisted significantly more often than when they pointed and received labels, suggesting that they were most satisfied with receiving labels for objects compared with functions or no information. Infants successfully mapped both labels and functions onto objects. When infants expressed their interest in a novel object in a manner other than pointing, such as reaching, they (a) were equally satisfied with receiving object labels, functions, or no information and (b) did not successfully learn either labels or functions. Together, these findings demonstrate that infants' pointing gestures are specific requests for labels that facilitate the acquisition of various types of information. In doing so, this work connects the research on information seeking during infancy to the established literature on question asking during childhood.},

However, the existing materials that measure the sensorimotor basis of word meanings and concepts have been restricted in terms of their sample size and breadth of sensorimotor experience. Here we present norms of sensorimotor strength for 39,707 concepts across six perceptual modalities (touch, hearing, smell, taste, vision, and interoception) and five action effectors (mouth/throat, hand/arm, foot/leg, head excluding mouth/throat, and torso), gathered from a total of 3,500 individual participants using Amazon's Mechanical Turk platform. The Lancaster Sensorimotor Norms are unique and innovative in a number of respects: They represent the largest-ever set of semantic norms for English, at 40,000 words \texttimes{} 11 dimensions (plus several informative cross-dimensional variables), they extend perceptual strength norming to the new modality of interoception, and they include the first norming of action strength across separate bodily effectors. In the first study, we describe the data collection procedures, provide summary descriptives of the dataset, and interpret the relations observed between sensorimotor dimensions. We then report two further studies, in which we (1) extracted an optimal single-variable composite of the 11-dimension sensorimotor profile (Minkowski 3 strength) and (2) demonstrated the utility of both perceptual and action strength in facilitating lexical decision times and accuracy in two separate datasets. These norms provide a valuable resource to researchers in diverse areas, including psycholinguistics, grounded cognition, cognitive semantics, knowledge representation, machine learning, and big-data approaches to the analysis of language and conceptual representations.

We show that CDI reports can serve as a basis for estimating infants' and toddlers'total vocabulary sizes, beyond serving as a tool for assessing their language development relative to other infants and toddlers. We investigate the link between estimated total vocabulary size and raw CDI scores from a mathematical perspective, using both single developmental trajectories and population data. The method capitalizes on robust regularities, such as the overlap of individual vocabularies observed across infants and toddlers, and takes into account both shared knowledge and idiosyncratic knowledge. This statistical approach enables researchers to approximate the total vocabulary size of an infant or a toddler, based on her raw MacArthur-Bates CDI score. Using the model, we propose new normative data for productive and receptive vocabulary in early childhood, as well as a tabulation that relates individual CDI measures to realistic lexical estimates. The correction required to estimate total vocabulary is non-linear, with a far greater impact at older ages and higher CDI scores. Therefore, we suggest that correlations of developmental indices to language skills should be made to vocabulary size as estimated by the model rather than to raw CDI scores.},

Yet, verbs appear in children's earliest vocabularies, creating a seeming paradox. This paper examines one hypothesis about the difference between noun and verb acquisition. Perhaps the advantage nouns have is not a function of grammatical form class but rather is related to a word's imageability. Here, word imageability ratings and form class (nouns and verbs) were correlated with age of acquisition according to the MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventory (CDI; Fenson et al., 1994). CDI age of acquisition was negatively correlated with words' imageability ratings. Further, a word's imageability contributes to the variance of the word's age of acquisition above and beyond form class, suggesting that at the beginning of word learning, imageability might be a driving factor.},

It is easy to see why gaze following could contribute to word learning. In everyday settings, caretakers provide verbal labels for objects they are looking at. Of course, language also refers to absent and hypothetical objects, parents and children use nonnominal expressions, and there is Quine's (1960) indeterminacy problem. Nonetheless, empirical work shows that much of infant-directed speech is about here and now, whole objects-labeling the perceptually present ball, dog, or cup. It has been argued that when several objects are perceptually available to the child, checking the speaker's gaze direction could help the child locate the object to which the speaker is referring. In Bruner's (1983) initial word learning game, if infants want to know what mom is labeling, they will get a big boost by following her eyes. She is probably not labeling what is behind her back or on the next page of the book or on the roof of the house. However, determining what mom is looking at is, itself, a developmental achievement. In this chapter we discuss the ontogeny of gaze following, carefully distinguishing it from the broader umbrella term of joint visual attention (JVA). After clarifying the definitional and methodological landscape, we discuss longitudinal work that examines the relation between gaze following and early vocabulary growth.

As a step toward a mechanistic theory of language acquisition, we present a framework of ``learning through processing'' and relate it to the prevailing methods used to assess children's early knowledge of words. Incorporating recent empirical work, we posit a specific, testable timeline of qualitative changes in the learning process in this interval. We conclude with several challenges and avenues for building a comprehensive theory of early word learning: better characterization of the input, reconciling results across approaches, and treating lexical knowledge in the nascent grammar with sufficient sophistication to ensure generalizability across languages and development.}

  abstract = {This study investigated the validity of a parent report measure of vocabulary development, the MacArthur Communicative Development Inventory: Words and Sentences (CDI), in children with and without developmental disabilities. Concurrent validity was examined by comparing results from the CDI and laboratory measures of vocabulary in 44 children with Down syndrome and 46 typically developing children with mental ages from 12 to 27 months. Significant correlations between .70 and .82 were obtained. Predictive validity was examined by measuring the vocabulary of 20 children with Down syndrome and 23 typically developing children first at approximately 20 months mental age and later at a mental age of approximately 28 months. Significant correlations were obtained between the CDI at Time A and all but one of the vocabulary measures at Time B (r = .46 to .66). These results establish the validity of parent measures of vocabulary development for children with Down syndrome and confirm their validity for typically developing children.},

Eight totally blind children and eight children whose vision was severely impaired were visited at home at around 18 months of age and video-recordings were made of each child interacting with a familiar caretaker. It was found that the parents of blind children were more likely to initiate interactions themselves and tended to use verbal comments unaccompanied by actions more frequently. They were less likely to talk about objects which were at the child's current focus of attention and were more likely to describe the properties of objects to the child using general terms such as pronouns or general nouns. In addition, they tended to request verbal information from their children in contrast to the parents of severely visually impaired children, who were more likely to describe objects for them. Children in both groups received more requests for action than any other utterance type and all parents made infrequent mention of the attributes of objects. The differences between the groups are discussed in terms of the difficulties faced particularly by parents of blind children in initiating and sustaining interactions.},

  abstract = {Around their first birthdays, infants begin to point, walk, and talk. These abilities are appreciable both by researchers with strictly standardized criteria and caregivers with more relaxed notions of what each of these skills entails. Here we compare the onsets of these skills and links among them across two data collection methods: observation and parental report. We examine pointing, walking, and talking in a sample of 44 infants studied longitudinally from 6\textendash 18 months. In this sample, links between pointing and vocabulary were tighter than those between walking and vocabulary, supporting a unified socio-communicative growth account. Indeed, across several cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses, pointers had larger vocabularies than their non-pointing peers. In contrast to previous work, this did not hold for walkers' vs. crawlers' vocabularies in our sample. Comparing across data sources, we find that reported and observed estimates of the growing vocabulary and of age of walk onset were closely correlated, while agreement between parents and researchers on pointing onset and talking onset was weaker. Taken together, these results support a developmental account in which gesture and language are intertwined aspects of early communication and symbolic thinking, whereas the shift from crawling to walking appears indistinct from age in its relation with language. We conclude that pointing, walking, and talking are on similar timelines yet distinct from one another, and discuss methodological and theoretical implications in the context of early development.},

Infants and mothers were submitted to 2 conditions in which the mother either gazed (JVA condition) or gazed and pointed (pointing condition) at 4 identical targets. Results showed the referential aspect to be understood at 12 mo in the JVA task and at 15 mo in the pointing task. The spatial aspect was understood at 15 mo for pointing and at 18 mo for JVA.

We present modality norms for 643 Italian adjectives, which referred to one of the five perceptual modalities or were abstract. Overall, words were rated as mostly connected to the visual modality and least connected to the olfactory and gustatory modality. We found that words associated to visual and auditory experience were more unimodal compared to words associated to other sensory modalities. A principal components analysis highlighted a strong coupling between gustatory and olfactory information in word meaning, and the tendency of words referring to tactile experience to also include information from the visual dimension. Abstract words were found to encode only marginal perceptual information, mostly from visual and auditory experience. The modality norms were augmented with corpus\textendash based (e.g., Zipf Frequency, Orthographic Levenshtein Distance 20) and ratings\textendash based psycholinguistic variables (Age of Acquisition, Familiarity, Contextual Availability). Split-half correlations performed for each experimental variable and comparisons with similar databases confirmed that our norms are highly reliable. This database thus provides a new important tool for investigating the interplay between language, perception and cognition.},

Previous research has found that words higher in BOI tend to be processed more quickly and accurately in tasks such as lexical decision, semantic decision, and syntactic classification, suggesting that sensorimotor information is an important aspect of lexical knowledge. However, limited research has examined the importance of sensorimotor information from a developmental perspective. One barrier to addressing such theoretical questions has been a lack of semantic dimension ratings that take into account child sensorimotor experience. The goal of the current study was to collect Child BOI rating norms. Parents of children aged 5 to 9 years old were asked to rate words according to how easily an average 6-year-old child can interact with each word's referent. The relationships of Child and Adult BOI ratings with other lexical semantic dimensions were assessed, as well as the relationships of Child and Adult BOI ratings with age of acquisition. Child BOI ratings were more strongly related to valence and sensory experience ratings than Adult BOI ratings and were a better predictor of three different measures of age of acquisition. The results suggest that child-centric ratings such as those reported here provide a more sensitive measure of children's experience that can be used to address theoretical questions in embodied cognition from a developmental perspective.},

Infants of 9, 14, 20, and 24 months were observed looking at picture books with their mothers. The integration of pointing with verbal and visual behaviors together with activities pertaining to the task, such as page turning, are described. Pointing emerges at 9 months but is not integrated with vocal activity until 14 months. Mothers synchronize their own pointing and verbal labeling from 9 months upward; however, from 2 years on it is the child who is asked to name the referent. The evidence also suggests that pointing and its concomitant behaviors are considerably influenced by a variety of factors-some arising from the situation in which the dyad is placed, others relating to the age of the infant.},

The first set of analyses established   the validity of this measure of acquisition order by comparing it with   order of acquisition data obtained from checklist and diary data. The  second set of analyses revealed that three properties of the input were   significant predictors of the order of acquisition of the 25 verbs that  were  the focus of this study. The predictive properties of input were the total   frequency, final position frequency, and diversity of syntactic environments   in which the verbs appeared. These findings suggest that the way  verbs appear in input influences their ease of acquisition. More specifically,   the effect of syntactic diversity in input provides support for the  syntactic bootstrapping account of how children use structural information   to learn the meaning of new verbs.},

In Experiment 3, infants heard different combinations of sentences from English, Dutch, Spanish, and Italian.

The first 50 words acquired by each child are analyzed in terms of grammatical form, content, and semantic structure. In general, children began by naming objects exhibiting salient properties of change whether as the result of the child's own action (e. g., "ball") or independent of it (e. g., "car"). They learned words of all major, grammatical form classes and tended to differentiate small concept domains-for example, food words or animals-from the beginning. Children differed in the functional type of vocabulary (referential or expressive) acquired and in the length of their initial speech units as well as in the content-the particular referents they chose to name. These differences were related to patterns of language acquisition; for example, referential speakers built larger vocabularies more quickly than did expressive speakers. Certain strategies used by children for acquiring first words-comprehension, production, imitation, repetition, and questioning-were found to be related to language progress. For example, comprehension at 15 months was positively related to all later indices of language maturity, while spontaneous imitation at 24 months was indicative of immature speech. A non-directive parental strategy that was accepting of the child's behavior-both verbal and nonverbal-facilitated the child's progress in language acquisition. In general, mothers gave very little contingent feedback to their language-learning children and showed very little expansion of utterances. All mothers, however, used short (three to four words) sentences to them. Environmental factors that were associated with the child's language progress-for example, many outings, exposure to many adults, little T. V. -appeared to be a function of facilitating mother attitudes. An interaction model that interrelates the child's preverbal concepts, his acquisition strategies, and parental-acceptance patterns is presented as a framework for understanding these findings. Acquisition histories of individual children illustrate the way in which these factors interact.}

We show that the noun bias in early vocabularies is far from universal, and that it rests only in part on the acquisition of object names. An analysis of vocabulary composition from 45 children at 1;8 indicates that more nouns are acquired than all other word classes, but that of the nouns acquired only about half are the names of basic level object classes (BLOCS). An examination of the use of nouns in mother-child discourse shows that non-object words referencing locations, actions and events, for example, are used in distinctive pragmatic and grammatical contexts which might enable a child to grasp the word's use and eventually its meaning. It is concluded that a theory of lexical acquisition in discourse context is required to explain word learning at all levels and for all word types. Implications for semantic bootstrapping theories are considered.},

MLU for IRR speech was greater than that for productive utterances, which supports the idea that these productions facilitate language development. The blind girl used routines and modified imitations and repetitions more frequently than her sighted sister, and her use of modified repetitions increased during the study. She also seemed to use IRR speech for a longer period in her development. Both children frequently used these forms as a means of maintaining conversation and to fulfil their intentions. By introducing modifications (varying some element, or expanding the model) both children, especially the blind girl, analysed language and learned to use these utterances in the appropriate circumstances with a clear pragmatic function. Such behaviour is typical of holistic language processing and acquisition.},

Data are presented which run counter to this view. These come from a longitudinal study of a blind child and her sighted twin sister. The study began when the children were 2 : 5 years old and spanned nearly three years. Mean length of utterances, over-regularizations, pronoun errors, pragmatic speech functions, and imitations, repetitions and routines (IRR) were analysed. The results clearly show that the language of the blind child is neither delayed, nor aberrant. Evidence is shown that IRR form part of a mechanism of language analysis, which is specially used by the blind girl, who seems to manifest a Gestalt style of language learning.},

  abstract = {This book provides an up-to-date account of blind children's developing communicative abilities with particular emphasis on social cognition and language acquisition from infancy to early school age. It purports to foster dialogue between those interested in the study of typically developing children and those interested in the development of children who are blind and to provide insights and new explanations of why the development of blind children may differ from that of sighted children. The book also aims to identify and examine current theoretical issues which are likely to be at the centre of developments in the fields of child language and developmental psychology.Language Development and Social Interaction in Blind Children is also a timely book. The study of blind children's development constitutes a unique opportunity to study the effect of vision on development, and more specifically on the development of language and certain aspects of social cognition. Current interest in the development of "theory of mind" and perspective taking in language learning, make the case of blind children crucial to our understanding of certain aspects of psychological functioning. The book explores these issues, challenges some widely-held beliefs about the development of communication in blind children, and provides a cohesive picture of our knowledge to date.},

In three experiments with English and two with Spanish, we asked native speakers to rate the iconicity of \textasciitilde 600 words from the English and Spanish MacArthur-Bates Communicative Developmental Inventories. We found that iconicity in the words of both languages varied in a theoretically meaningful way with lexical category. In both languages, adjectives were rated as more iconic than nouns and function words, and corresponding to typological differences between English and Spanish in verb semantics, English verbs were rated as relatively iconic compared to Spanish verbs. We also found that both languages exhibited a negative relationship between iconicity ratings and age of acquisition. Words learned earlier tended to be more iconic, suggesting that iconicity in early vocabulary may aid word learning. Altogether these findings show that iconicity is a graded quality that pervades vocabularies of even the most ``arbitrary'' spoken languages. The findings provide compelling evidence that iconicity is an important property of all languages, signed and spoken, including Indo-European languages.},

Gibson, J.J., 1966) by synchronizing the saying of a word with a dynamic gesture displaying the object/referent (Zukow-Goldring, 1997). Detecting an amodal invariant across gesture and speech brackets the word and object within the auditory and visual flow of events and constitutes the basis for perceiving them as belonging together (Zukow-Goldring and Rader, 2001; cf. Spence, 2007). To test the effect of gesture on infant attention and word learning, we presented 9\textendash 14-month-old infants with videos of speakers using synchronous dynamic, static, or asynchronous dynamic gestures. We hypothesized that infants would attend more to the object at the time the word was spoken when the gesture was dynamic and synchronous with speech and that this synchrony would result in better word learning. We found that infants looked more at the object at the critical time and displayed better word learning in the dynamic synchronous condition compared with the other gesture conditions. These results highlight the key role that synchronizing word and gesture plays in infants' learning of the correspondence between word and referent.},

Several brain imaging studies have provided evidence for cortical reorganization due to visual deprivation but the cerebral organization of language in blind humans is not known yet. We hypothesized that the increasing specialization of language systems normally observed during development may not take place to the same degree in blind individuals since posterior visual areas do not receive their adequate input. On the other hand, we hypothesized that blind people, due to their greater reliance upon the auditory language signal, may process speech faster than sighted people. To test these assumptions, event-related potentials were recorded while 11 congenitally blind and 11 sighted adults matched in age, gender, handedness and education were engaged in a language task. Participants listened to sentences in order to decide after each sentence if it was meaningful or not. Incongruous sentence-final words elicited an N400 effect in both groups. The N400 effect had a left-lateralized fronto-central scalp distribution in the sighted but a symmetric and broad topography in the blind. Furthermore, the N400 effect started earlier in the blind than in the sighted. Closed class compared to open class sentence middle words elicited a more pronounced late negativity in the blind than in the sighted. These results suggest that blind people process auditory language stimuli faster than sighted people and that some language functions may be reorganized in the blind.},

The present study used a semantic and morpho-syntactic priming paradigm to address the question at which processing stage the advantage of blind adults may arise. Congenitally blind adults and sighted controls matched for age, gender and education, first heard an adjective followed by a noun or a pseudo-word. The adjective was or was not semantically associated with the target and it was either correctly or incorrectly inflected for gender with respect to the following noun. Participants decided whether or not the target noun was a legal German word. Nouns primed semantically and morpho-syntactically had shorter lexical decision times than those primed only semantically or only morpho-syntactically and decision times for the latter two conditions were shorter than in a condition without a semantically or morpho-syntactically congruent context. This response pattern did not differ between groups. However, blind participants had shorter reaction times than sighted for pseudo-words, and overall decision times for words tended to be shorter in the blind as well. It is concluded that the faster speech comprehension skills of blind adults most likely originate from a more efficient perceptual analysis rather than from a more extended use of semantic or morpho-syntactic context information.}

  abstract = {Children learn words through an accumulation of interactions grounded in context. Although many factors in the learning environment have been shown to contribute to word learning in individual studies, no empirical synthesis connects across factors. We introduce a new ultradense corpus of audio and video recordings of a single child's life that allows us to measure the child's experience of each word in his vocabulary. This corpus provides the first direct comparison, to our knowledge, between different predictors of the child's production of individual words. We develop a series of new measures of the distinctiveness of the spatial, temporal, and linguistic contexts in which a word appears, and show that these measures are stronger predictors of learning than frequency of use and that, unlike frequency, they play a consistent role across different syntactic categories. Our findings provide a concrete instantiation of classic ideas about the role of coherent activities in word learning and demonstrate the value of multimodal data in understanding children's language acquisition. word learning | language acquisition | multimodal corpus analysis | diary study Adults swim effortlessly through a sea of words, recognizing and producing tens of thousands every day. Children are immersed in these waters from birth, gaining expertise in navigating with language over their first years. Their skills grow gradually over millions of small interactions within the context of their daily lives. How do these experiences combine to support the emergence of new knowledge? In our current study, we describe an analysis of how individual interactions enable the child to learn and use words, using a high-density corpus of a single child's experiences and novel analysis methods for characterizing the child's exposure to each word. Learning words requires children to reason synthetically, putting together their emerging language understanding with their knowledge about both the world and the people in it (1, 2). Many factors contribute to word learning, ranging from social information about speakers' intentions (3, 4) to biases that lead children to extend categories appropriately (5, 6). However, the contribution of individual factors is usually measured either for a single word in the laboratory or else at the level of a child's vocabulary size (4, 6, 7). Although a handful of studies have attempted to predict the acquisition of individual words outside the laboratory, they have typically been limited to analyses of only a single factor: frequency of use in the language the child hears (8, 9). Despite the importance of synthesis, both for theory and for applications like language intervention, virtually no research in this area connects across factors to ask which ones are most predictive of learning. Creating such a synthesis, our goal here, requires two ingredients: predictor variables measuring features of language input and outcome variables measuring learning. Both of these sets of measurements can be problematic. Examining predictor variables first, the primary empirical focus has been on the quantity of language the child hears. Word frequencies can easily be calculated from transcripts (7, 8), and overall quantity can even be estimated via automated methods (10). Sheer frequency may not be the best predictor of word learning, however. Although some quantity of speech is a prerequisite for learning, the quality of this speech, and the interactions that support it, is likely to be a better predictor of learning (2, 11, 12). In the laboratory, language that is embedded within coherent and comprehensible social activities gives strong support for meaning learning (3, 13). In addition, the quantity of speech directed toward the child predicts development more effectively than total speech overheard by the child (14). Presumably, what makes high-quality, child-directed speech valuable is that this kind of talk is grounded in a set of rich activities and interactions that support the child's inferences about meaning (2, 11). Measuring contextually grounded talk of this type is an important goal, yet one that is challenging to achieve at scale. In our analyses, we introduce data-driven measures that quantify whether words are used in distinctive activities and interactions , and we test whether these measures predict the child's development. Outcome variables regarding overall language uptake are also difficult to measure, especially for young children. Language uptake can refer to both word comprehension and word production , with comprehension typically occurring substantially earlier for any given word (15). In-laboratory procedures using looking time, pointing, or event-related potentials can yield reliable and detailed measures of young children's comprehension, but, typically, only for a handful of words (e.g., refs. 14, 16). For systematic assessment of overall vocabulary size, the only methods standardly used with children younger than the age of 3 y are parent report checklists (15) and assessment of production through vocabulary samples (8). We adopt this second method here. By leveraging an extremely dense dataset, we can make precise and objective estimates of the child's productive vocabulary through Significance The emergence of productive language is a critical milestone in a child's life. Laboratory studies have identified many individual factors that contribute to word learning, and larger scale studies show correlations between aspects of the home environment and language outcomes. To date, no study has compared across many factors involved in word learning. We introduce a new ultradense set of recordings that capture a single child's daily experience during the emergence of language. We show that words used in distinctive spatial, temporal , and linguistic contexts are produced earlier, suggesting they are easier to learn. These findings support the importance of multimodal context in word learning for one child and provide new methods for quantifying the quality of children's language input.},

Method Fifty-five infants and mothers were video-recorded playing together with a standard set of toys at Time 1 (T1) mean age 12.95 months (8.13\textendash 17.05 months). Maintain was categorized as the mother following and maintaining the child's focus, and Sensitivity, the mother's responsiveness and contingency to infant behaviour. Vision level was measured using the Near Detection Scale. Cognition and language were measured at T1, 12 months later (T2) and 24 months later (T3) using the Reynell-Zinkin Scales. Results Cross-sectional analyses showed that mothers of infants with severe VI (basic form vision) produced higher rates of Maintain compared to those with children with profound VI (light perception at best). Linear mixed-effects models examining developmental progression from T1 to T3 (controlling for vision level) showed an average increase of 5 DQ points (CI 95\%: 1.03\textendash 9.08) in verbal comprehension for higher Sensitivity. No significant findings were found for Maintain. Conclusions The findings suggest that mother\textendash infant interactions (maternal Maintain) are associated with level of vision at infancy, but only maternal Sensitivity has a long-term positive association with advances in verbal comprehension from infancy to about three years. They highlight the need for incorporating strategies related to parent\textendash infant interactions, including increased sensitivity, into early intervention for children with visual impairment.},

Previous research has concentrated on semantic and syntactic aspects of processing. Here we investigated phonologically mediated spoken word access processes by means of word onset priming. Blind adults and age- and gender-matched sighted adults listened to spoken word onsets (primes) followed by complete words (targets). Phonological overlap between primes and targets varied. Blind participants made faster lexical decision responses than sighted participants, yet their speeded responses were not restricted to phonologically overlapping trials. Furthermore, timing of Event Related Potential (ERP) results did not differ between blind and sighted participants. Together these results suggest that blind and sighted listeners are equally fast in implicit phonological encoding and lexical matching mechanisms. It appears that blind adults' speeded speech processing emerges when phonological analysis makes promising word candidates available for further processing. As one possible interpretation, we speculate that lexical selection processes in blind adults do not need to wait for information from the visual domain, while auditory-visual integration mechanisms are mandatorily implemented in speech recognition routines of sighted adults.},

Aggregated across children, the distribution of these first productive uses of language can act as a window into early cognitive and linguistic development. We investigate both the variability and predictability in children's first words across four new datasets. We find, first, that children's first words tend to emerge earlier than previously estimated: more than 75 percent of children produce their first word before their first birthday. Second, we find a high degree of consistency in the types of things children name in their first words, independent of the age at which they are produced. Finally, we show that the particular words that children produce first are predictable from two linguistic factors: input frequency and phonological complexity. Together, our results suggest a degree of independence between early conceptual and linguistic development.},

We found that 6-month-old infants followed the adult's gaze (a potential communicative-referential signal) toward an object only when such an act is preceded by ostensive cues such as direct gaze (experiment 1) and infant-directed speech (experiment 2). Such a link between the presence of ostensive signals and gaze following suggests that this behavior serves a functional role in assisting infants to effectively respond to referential communication directed to them. Whereas gaze following in many nonhuman species supports social information gathering 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, in humans it initially appears to reflect the expectation of a more active, communicative role from the information source.},

Using head-mounted eye tracking, the present study objectively measured individual differences in the moment-to-moment variability of visual instances of the same object, from infants' first-person views. Infants who generated more variable visual object images through manual object manipulation at 15 months of age experienced greater vocabulary growth over the next six months. Elucidating infants' everyday visual experiences with objects may constitute a crucial missing link in our understanding of the developmental trajectory of object name learning.},

Analyses of the head camera views indicate visual experiences with profoundly different dynamic structures. The toddler view often consists of a single dominating object that is close to the sensors and thus that blocks the view of other objects such that individual objects go in and out of view. The adult view, in contrast, is broad and stable, with all potential targets continually in view. These differences may arise for several developmentally relevant reasons, including the small visuo-motor workspace of the toddler (short arms) and the engagement of the whole body when actively handling objects.},

The main dependent measures were derived from frame-by-frame analyses of eye gaze direction. The fine- grained dynamics of looking behavior implicates different attentional processes that may compete with or support statistical learning. The discussion considers the role of attention in binding heard words to seen objects, individual differences in attention and vocabulary development, and the relation between macro-level theories of word learning and the micro-level dynamic processes that underlie learning.},

Here we use a recently developed technique to show that when they are required to pair words with objects, infants of 14 months fail to use the fine phonetic detail they detect in syllable discrimination tasks. In contrast, infants of 8 months\textemdash who are not yet readily learning words\textemdash successfully discriminate phonetic detail in the same task in which infants aged 14 months fail.

METHOD: Parents of 222 British-English-speaking children aged 27(+/-3) months completed a British adaptation of the MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventory: Words and Sentences (MCDI; Klee \& Harrison, 2001). Child words were coded for ND and WF, and the relationships among vocabulary, ND, and WF were examined. A cut-point of -1 SD below the mean on the MCDI classified children into one of two groups: low or high vocabulary size. Group differences on ND and WF were examined using nonparametric statistics. RESULTS: In a hierarchical regression, ND and WF accounted for 47\% and 14\% of unique variance in MCDI scores, respectively. Low-vocabulary children scored significantly higher on ND and significantly lower on WF than did high-vocabulary children, but there was more variability in ND and WF for children at the lowest points of the vocabulary continuum. CONCLUSION: Children at the lowest points of a continuum of vocabulary size may be extracting statistical properties of the input language in a manner quite different from their more able age peers.},

If true, then LTs' receptive (passive), as well as active lexicons should be comprised of words of high ND. However, in the current research only active lexicons were of high ND.

To investigate whether the characteristics of mother-child discourse were associated with the child's socio-communicative competence. METHODS \& PROCEDURES: Mother-child discourse with twelve 6-12-year-old children with VI was coded during a shared book-reading narrative and compared with 14 typically sighted children matched in age and verbal ability. OUTCOMES \& RESULTS: Mothers of children with VI elaborated more and made significantly more references to story characters' mental states and descriptive elaborations than mothers of sighted children. Mental state elaborations of mothers in the VI group related positively with the level produced by their children, with the association remaining after mothers' overall verbosity and children's developmental levels were controlled for. Frequency of maternal elaborations, including their mental state language, was related to socio-communicative competence of children with VI. CONCLUSIONS \& IMPLICATIONS: The findings offer insights into the potential contribution of maternal verbal scaffolding to mentalistic language and social-communicative competences of children with VI.},

Researchers coded the temporal onsets and offsets of infant and mother object exploration and mothers' referential (e.g., ``That's a bead'') and regulatory (e.g., ``Stop it'') language. The times when infant or mother were neither exploring objects nor communicating were classified as ``off task.'' Sequential analysis was used to examine whether certain maternal behaviors were more (or less) likely to follow infant object exploration relative to chance, to one another, and to times when infants were off task. Mothers were more likely to explore objects and use referential language in response to infant object exploration than to use regulatory language or be off task, and maternal behaviors were reduced in the context of infants being off task. Additionally, mothers coordinated their object exploration with referential language specifically; thus, mothers' responses to infants were didactic and multimodal. Infant object exploration elicits reciprocal object exploration and informative verbal input from mothers, illustrating the active role infants play in their social experiences.},

Method: Twenty-four children with cochlear implants and their mothers participated in this study. Children ranged in age from 32 months to 86 months (the majority were 32 to 66 months old). The number of months postimplantation ranged from 3 to 60 (the majority were around 24 months). Mothers completed the CDI before behavioral testing. Behavioral measures included the Reynell Developmental Language Scales and measures of vocabulary and grammar from a spontaneous language sample. Results: Both the Words and Gestures and the Words and Sentences forms of the CDI were shown to have excellent validity for this sample of children, if they had language that was in the range measured by the instrument. Correlations with behavioral measures ranged from .41 to .93 and were comparable to those reported for children with typical development. Conclusions: The CDI forms are valid tools to use with children who are using cochlear implants and who are in the early stages of language development, even if they are older than the norming sample. Age-equivalence may be obtained if children score below the median for the oldest age norms. They may also be used to describe the language of children who are not at ceiling. Specific recommendations for interventionists are provided. Key Words: cochlear implants, validity of parent report, language development},

This is data derived both from our sensory-motor interactions with the outside world, as well as from our experience of own inner states, particularly our emotions. The second type of information is language-based. In particular, it is derived from the general linguistic context in which words appear.

At each session, the S was presented with an object moving slowly in different ways in front of him or her. In the middle of each session there was also a 1-min period with no object present. Results show that the amount of prereaching declined at 7 wks and that this decrease was contingent on the presence of the object. Ss did not seem to lose interest in the object at this age, but attending to the object inhibited prereaching activity in some way. The form of prereaching also changed at 7 wks, with the fist clenched during the forward extension of the arm. After this age, the amount of prereaching activity again increased and the hand opened during the forward extension, but only when the S looked at the object.

Exp 1 established an adult criterion for the development. Adults started closing the hand around the target well before touch, and the timing was dependent on the size of the target. The hand started to close earlier when grasping a small rather than a large target. In addition, the degree of hand opening was also less for a small than for a large target. In Exp 2, infants who were 5\textendash 6, 9, and 13 months of age also controlled their grasping actions visually and started closing the hand around the target in anticipation of the encounter rather than as a reaction to the encounter. The strategy of the two younger age groups was different from that of adults. They started closing the hand closer to the time of contact with the target than did the 13-month-olds, who were comparable to adults in this respect. In all age groups, reaching and grasping were most commonly organized in a continuous way; the hand started to close without any interruption in the approach. The opening of the hand was adjusted to target size in the 9- and 13-month-olds but not in the 5\textendash 6 month olds. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

As the maturation of the nervous system imposes the most severe constraints on this development, an attempt is first made to summarize what is known about the motor pathways and the sensorimotor systems involved in manual development. The chapter then sketches the presumed major steps in the manual development of the human infant. Visual control of arm movements is already present in newborn infants, but the arm and the hand are synergistically coupled in these movements. As the arm extends, the hand opens and vice versa. This synergy is broken up at about 2 months as infants start to fist the hand vigorously as the arm extends. That pattern gives way to a more functional one in which the hand opens up during arm extension in preparation for grasping an object. Around 4 months of age, infants start to reach and grasp objects successfully. Major changes in the organization of the manual movements accompany this event. Vision takes a more prominent role in the control of hand movements as the infant gains ability to monitor the hand relative to a target. The major change in manual control during the second half of the 1st year of life is the appearance of differentiated finger movements and the},

In this study, we explored how the amount of speech directed to infants in Spanish-speaking families low in socioeconomic status influenced the development of children's skill in real-time language processing and vocabulary learning. All-day recordings of parent-infant interactions at home revealed striking variability among families in how much speech caregivers addressed to their child. Infants who experienced more child-directed speech became more efficient in processing familiar words in real time and had larger expressive vocabularies by the age of 24 months, although speech simply overheard by the child was unrelated to vocabulary outcomes. Mediation analyses showed that the effect of child-directed speech on expressive vocabulary was explained by infants' language-processing efficiency, which suggests that richer language experience strengthens processing skills that facilitate language growth.},

Word-learning tasks suggest that young infants (14 months old) confuse similar-sounding words, whereas mispronunciation detection tasks suggest that slightly older infants (18-24 months old) correctly distinguish similar words. Here we explore whether the difficulty at 14 months stems from infants' novice status as word learners or whether it is inherent in the task demands of learning new words. Results from 3 experiments support a developmental explanation. In Experiment 1, infants of 20 months learned to pair 2 phonetically similar words to 2 different objects under precisely the same conditions that infants of 14 months (Experiment 2) failed. In Experiment 3, infants of 17 months showed intermediate, but still successful, performance in the task. Vocabulary size predicted word-learning performance, but only in the younger, less experienced word learners. The implications of these results for theories of word learning and lexical representation are discussed.},

In comparison, sensory modalities that are less frequently talked about, particularly taste and smell, show less lexical differentiation. In addition, we show that even though sensory language can be expected to change across historical time and between contexts of use (e.g., spoken language versus fiction), the pattern of visual dominance is a stable property of the English language. Thus, we show that across the board, precisely those semantic domains that are more frequently talked about are also more lexically differentiated, for perceptual experiences.

However, the relevant visual scene for infant word learning is neither from the adult theorist's view nor the mature partner's view, but is rather from the learner's personal view. Here we show that when 18-month old infants interacted with objects in play with their parents, they created moments in which a single object was visually dominant. If parents named the object during these moments of bottom-up selectivity, later forced-choice tests showed that infants learned the name, but did not when naming occurred during a less visually selective moment. The momentary visual input for parents and toddlers was captured via head cameras placed low on each participant's forehead as parents played with and named objects for their infant. Frame-by-frame analyses of the head camera images at and around naming moments were conducted to determine the visual properties at input that were associated with learning. The analyses indicated that learning occurred when bottom-up visual information was clean and uncluttered. The sensory-motor behaviors of infants and parents were also analyzed to determine how their actions on the objects may have created these optimal visual moments for learning. The results are discussed with respect to early word learning, embodied attention, and the social role of parents in early word learning.},
